# Challenge 2 - Spinning circles

I initially tried to do this one with legacy OpenGL (hence the "web" part of
the directory name), however, setting the alpha for the glClear function turned
out not to be trivial, so I ended up simply translating the code I already
wrote for that over to JavaScript and coding this using a HTML canvas.

## Do I plan on trying to make it work in OpenGL again?

Probably not anytime soon, but it is something I would like to do eventually,
possibly when I get better with modern OpenGL, and when I feel like figuring
out why OpenGL (or SDL2) doesn't listen to my opacity preferences.
